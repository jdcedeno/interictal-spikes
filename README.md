Final project for Florida International University's course EEL 6836 - Computer Visualization of Brain Electrical Activity
### Abstract
Epilepsy is an illness of the human brain in which the patient suffers recurrent, unprovoked seizures, and although this disorder is not lethal or contagious it can be dangerous to the individual because of its unpredictable nature, since seizures can happen at any moment without warning and could put the patient’s and other people’s lives at risk. 

The study of this illness is important because it affects approximately 50 million people worldwide, and there is a need to improve the processes involved in the detection of the area of the brain that is responsible for the seizures. To achieve this several examinations are performed, some of which are the Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The EEG is preferred due to its lower cost and higher time resolution to detect events happening in the brain.

The analysis of EEG data is done manually by neurologists, who perform a visual examination of the data and decide where and when Interictal spikes occur relying only on their expertise. This process can take up a lot of a neurologist’s valuable time, and so, an important advancement would be the implementation of an automated method to detect interictal spikes, alleviating some of the neurologist’s work.
